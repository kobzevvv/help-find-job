# Resume Structure Implementation Summary

## Goal

Implement a "structure my resume" command for the Telegram bot that uses an external resume processing service to convert raw resume text into structured JSON format.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Resume Processor Service (`src/services/resume-processor.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Handles communication with external resume processing API
- **Features**:
  - Process resume text and return structured data
  - Health check for service availability
  - Format structured resume data for display in Russian
  - Support for Russian language processing
  - Error handling and timeout management

### 2. Updated Session Management

- **Enhanced `UserSession` type** (`src/types/session.ts`):
  - Added `structuredResume` field to store processed resume data
  - Added `structuring_resume` conversation state
- **Enhanced `SessionService`** (`src/services/session.ts`):
  - `saveStructuredResume()` - Save structured resume data
  - `getStructuredResume()` - Retrieve structured resume data

### 3. New Telegram Command

- **Command**: `/structure_my_resume` (also accepts `/structure_resume`)
- **Russian Description**: "Структурировать резюме"
- **Functionality**:
  - Checks if user has saved resume text
  - Validates resume text length (minimum 50 characters)
  - Calls external resume processor service
  - Saves structured data to user session
  - Displays formatted structured resume
  - Handles long messages by splitting into chunks
  - Shows processing time and metadata

### 4. Updated Service Container

- **Added ResumeProcessorService** to dependency injection container
- **Updated ConversationHandler** to include resume processor service
- **Proper dependency management** for all services

### 5. Updated Bot Commands

- **Added new command** to `scripts/set-bot-commands.js`
- **Updated help message** to include new command
- **Maintains Russian interface** as requested

## Technical Details

### External Service Integration

- **API Endpoint**: `https://resume-processor-worker.dev-a96.workers.dev`
- **Health Check**: `GET /health`
- **Process Resume**: `POST /process-resume`
- **Language Support**: Russian (ru) as default
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per minute per client

### Data Structure

The service returns structured resume data including:

- **Desired titles** (job positions)
- **Professional summary**
- **Skills** with proficiency levels (1-5 scale)
- **Work experience** with employer, title, dates, descriptions
- **Location preferences**
- **Schedule preferences**
- **Salary expectations**
- **Availability information**
- **Professional links**

### Error Handling

- Service health checks before processing
- Graceful error messages in Russian
- Timeout handling for external API calls
- Message length limits (Telegram 4096 character limit)
- Validation of resume text length

### User Experience

- **Russian interface** throughout
- **Progress indicators** during processing
- **Formatted output** with emojis and structure
- **Additional metadata** (processing time, AI model used)
- **Unmapped fields** reporting for debugging

## Testing

### Service Health Check

```bash
curl -X GET https://resume-processor-worker.dev-a96.workers.dev/health
```

✅ **Result**: Service is healthy and available

### Resume Processing Test

```bash
node scripts/test-resume-structure.js
```

✅ **Result**: All tests passed, processing time ~22 seconds

### Sample Output

The service successfully processes Russian resumes and returns structured data including:

- Desired job titles
- Professional summary
- Skills with proficiency levels
- Work experience entries
- All metadata and processing information

## Usage Flow

1. **User sends resume**: `/send_resume` → User provides resume text
2. **User structures resume**: `/structure_my_resume` → Bot processes resume
3. **Bot displays structured data**: Formatted resume with all sections
4. **Data is saved**: Structured resume stored in user session

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

- `src/services/resume-processor.ts` - Resume processor service
- `scripts/test-resume-structure.js` - Test script
- `RESUME_STRUCTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files

- `src/types/session.ts` - Added structured resume support
- `src/services/session.ts` - Added structured resume methods
- `src/handlers/conversation.ts` - Added structure command and processing
- `src/container/service-container.ts` - Added resume processor service
- `scripts/set-bot-commands.js` - Added new command

## Problems Solved

1. **External Service Integration**: Successfully integrated with external resume processor API
2. **Russian Language Support**: Full Russian interface and processing
3. **Data Persistence**: Structured resume data saved to user session
4. **User Experience**: Clear progress indicators and formatted output
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
6. **Message Length Limits**: Proper handling of long structured resumes
7. **Service Health**: Health checks before processing

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The bot now supports:

- `/send_resume` - Send resume text
- `/structure_my_resume` - Structure the resume using AI
- All existing functionality remains intact

The external service is working correctly and the integration is fully functional.
